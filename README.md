# Dynamic Community Detection

This repository compiles methods and experiments related to community structures in temporal networks.

Specifically, it is where Victor Brabant shares the work from his PhD research on "Dynamic Community Detection in Massive Link Streams."

The current code corresponds to the pre-print [*Longitudinal Modularity, a Modularity for Link Streams.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16877).
